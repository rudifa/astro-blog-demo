## Work through the Astro tutorial [Unit 6 - Astro Islands](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/6-islands/)

In this unit, we use Astro islands to bring frontend framework components into the Astro site.

We learn to:

- Add a UI framework, `Preact`, to the Astro project
- Use `Preact` to create an interactive greeting component
- Add the dark theme and a switch to toggle between light and dark themes
- Learn when we might not choose islands for interactivity
