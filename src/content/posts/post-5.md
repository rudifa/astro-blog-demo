## Work through the Astro tutorial [Unit 5 - Astro API](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/5-astro-api/)

In this unit, we supercharge the blog with an index page, tag pages, and an RSS feed.

Along the way, we learn how to use:

- `Astro.glob()` to access data from files in your project
- `getStaticPaths()` to create multiple pages (routes) at once
- The Astro RSS package to create an RSS feed
