## Work through the Astro tutorial [Extend with Content Collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorials/add-content-collections/)

In this tutorial, we learn how to:

- Move the *.md files from the `src/content/posts` directory to a new `src/content/collections` directory
- Create a schema to define the blog post frontmatter
- Use `getCollection()` to get blog post content and metadata
