Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished following the Astro tutorial [introduction](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/) and the [Unit 1 - Setup](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/1-setup/)

1. **Installing Astro**: Created a new Astro project and set up or checked my online accounts (github and netlify).

2. **Making Pages**: Learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Publish to Netlify**: Configured Netlify to publish this project after every poush or merge, as [astro-blog-again](https://astro-blog-again.netlify.app/).
