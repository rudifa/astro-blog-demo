Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## Work through the Astro tutorial [Unit 2 - Pages](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/2-pages/)

In Unit 2 we:

- Create first Astro pages with the .astro syntax
- Add blog posts with Markdown (.md) files
- Style an individual page with `<style>`
- Apply global styles across pages
