## Work through the Astro tutorial [Extend with View Transitions](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorials/add-view-transitions/)

In this tutorial, we learn how to:

- `import {ViewTransitions}` into the `BaseLayout.astro` component
- Apply it so that all page transitions are animated with a fade effect (default)
- Fix the menu and ThemeIcon scripts adding the appropriate event listeners
- Try applying different transition effects to page titles (works but not nice)
