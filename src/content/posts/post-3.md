Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## Work through the Astro tutorial [Unit 3 - Components](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/3-components/)

In Unit 3 we create astro Components:

- A Navigation component that presents a menu of links to your pages
- A Footer component to include at the bottom of each page
- A Social Media component, used in the Footer, that links to profile pages
- An interactive Hamburger component to toggle the Navigation on mobile
